# DATA-201-Projects
Each project will focus on a variety of data analysis methods, while maintaining some overall consistiency in the structure. The following list the project guidelines:
1. Introduction: Give the details on the source of your data, its content, and some
questions you are interested in.
2. Prepare and wrangle your data with Pandas and Numpy
3. Use EDA principles and the Matplotlib / Seaborn packages to visualize the data.

# Project 1
4. Use at least two of the following depending on your question of interest: pairplot,
histogram, barplot, boxplot, or scatterplot
5. Simulate a nonparametric inference of the Median for a quantitative variable in the
dataset
6. The sample size should be about 10% of the data. Use random sampling for the
rows

# Project 2
4. Use scikit-learn DecisionTree Classification or Regression to train, test and predict a categorical or quantitative target variable respectively. Use appropriate metric and interpret the meaning of the score.
5. In the case of classification, predict the classes of the test data. Predict the class probability of the test data
6. Plot the tree with tree.plot_tree after the training

# Final Project
4. Use scikit-learn KMeans to train the data. Use appropriate metric.
5. Plot the Elbow Method to choose optimal number of clusters
6. Check if the clusters differ with respect to certain interesting features
